# Playing-with-Turtle
Just run/open the code in IDLE the turtle graphics interface should work great.
I was playing with turtle a bit and liked the pattern, will play more around with it brings back school memories when turtle was a thing and thaught in school.
Lets bring back turtle.
Turtle is a Python library which used to create graphics, pictures, and games. It was developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Parpet and Cynthina Slolomon in 1967. It was a part of the original Logo programming language.
Back in 2006 we used to play a lot with turtle but now no one talks about it, not that it is really something outstanding but its fun to play with and people should know about it more..
